# Collection discovery (recommended)
# The server attempts to discover collection IDs from the Appwrite project at startup
# using the Appwrite credentials above. You do NOT need to set one env var per collection.
# If discovery fails the server will fall back to the following env vars (optional):
# APPWRITE_COLLECTION_REPORTS=reports
# APPWRITE_COLLECTION_FIGHTS=fights
# APPWRITE_COLLECTION_PLAYERS=player_performances
# APPWRITE_COLLECTION_STATUS=statuses

# Optional: provide a single JSON map instead of per-collection vars
# APPWRITE_COLLECTIONS_JSON='{"reports":"<id>","fights":"<id>","player_performances":"<id>","statuses":"<id>"}'
